At Berty, we have a true emphasis on our community. You are the driving force behind the project. We are more than ever grateful for the investment of time and effort you have made and will make.

Help us to fight censorship and mass surveillance because everyone’s privacy matters.

Please never underestimate your contribution. Little + Little = Big. We do believe in the butterfly effect. 

The Berty team.

## Community Rules

### Code of Conduct

This repository falls under the Berty [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/berty/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Language

We use the English language to spread widely the project!

## Contributing


![Contribute to Berty](https://assets.berty.tech/files/contribute-contribute_v2--Contribute-berty-ultra-light.gif)

We really welcome contributions. Your input is the most precious material. We're well aware of that and we thank you in advance. Everyone is encouraged to look at what they can do on their own scale; no effort is too small.  

There are plenty of ways to get involved and act for our community. It has been divided into two distinct parts: everything that is related to the code and everything that is not. 

To put it very simply:
* Code-related = Github
* Not code-related = Open task 

Everything on contribution is sum up here: [CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/berty/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Code

As you may know, all Berty's code is [open-source](https://berty.tech/blog/open-source/) and available on [Github](https://github.com/berty). The code is yours: `Own it, Use it, Test it, Fix it`.

To facilitate and centralize contributions, we rely only on Github for code contributions. We use `issues` as a discussion forum and contributions can be done in a pull request. 

If you're looking for something to get your feet wet working on Berty, take a look at the GitHub issues tagged [`good first issue`](https://github.com/berty/berty/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [`help wanted`](https://github.com/berty/berty/labels/help%20wanted).

Here is a bunch of contribution ideas:
* Answer the questions from the community on issues. 
* Fix bugs reported on issues.
* Send us a pull request.
* Review the existing pull request.
* Improve the documentation.
* Check out the architecture and review it.
* Hack on Berty.
* Contribute to the projects of the Berty ecosystem (mostly IPFS-related).
* Any other form of contribution that is not mentioned above. 😬


See [README](https://github.com/berty/berty) for details on submitting patches and the contribution workflow.

### Translation

As you may guess, we don't know every language. However, we want Berty to be accessible to as many people as possible. That's why we need as much material as possible translated into as many languages as possible. 

This can be the documentation, the app, the support, a blog post, even this page, or another section on the site. 

### Bugs and Report

We use GitHub issues for tracking requests and bugs. Please post the questions directly there using the 'bug' tag.

If you've got questions or issues with using Berty, check out our support page and be sure to connect to our community, where there's always someone ready to help.

### Support

For Berty to benefit as many people as possible, it is important to have the most comprehensive documentation available. If you have a question and the answer is not in the documentation/support page, please help us to update this section. 

Remember, if you have asked yourself the question, someone else will do the same.

> To help us improve our support page, reach @Camille.

### Website & Blog  
 
Having a good website helps make the Berty project as accessible as possible. So if you have any ideas for improvement (SEO, for example), let us know. We'll be happy to adjust!

Or maybe you have an idea of how to use Berty and you want to share it with the community? Write a nice blog post about your idea, and what it will change for you and your community. We'll be happy to spread the word!
